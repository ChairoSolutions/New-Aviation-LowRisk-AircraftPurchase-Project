# New Aviation Low-Risk Aircraft Purchase Project

## Introduction
This project analyzes aviation accidents and incident data collected from **1962–2023**, covering civil aviation accidents in the USA and selected international waters.
The goal is to provide actionable insights to the business stakeholders to support **informed investment decisions** when purchasing and operating low-risk aircraft for  commercial and private enterprises.  

By analysing historical accident trends, aircraft types, and incident patterns, this analysis will help identify **aircraft with lower operational risk**, ensuring safer investments for the New Aviation division.  

## Key Analysis Questions
To guide the analysis and provide insights relevant to decision-making, I will explore the following questions:

1. **Aircraft Risk Assessment**
   - Which aircraft models have the lowest accident and incident rates historically?
   - Are there trends in accident frequency based on aircraft age or manufacturer?
   
2. **Geographical Patterns**
   - Are certain regions or airspaces associated with higher incident rates?
   - Do accidents in international waters differ significantly from those in the USA?

3. **Operational and Safety Insights**
   - What factors (pilot experience, aircraft type, weather conditions) correlate with higher accident risk?
   - Are there particular operational conditions that consistently show low-risk performance?

## Stakeholder Questions
From a business and investment perspective, stakeholders would want to know:

- Which aircraft models are **safe and reliable for commercial or private operations**?  
- Are there aircraft types that offer **lower insurance costs or regulatory risk**?  
- How does historical safety performance inform **fleet diversification and procurement strategy**?  
- What operational precautions can be implemented to **minimize accident risk** for purchased aircraft?
